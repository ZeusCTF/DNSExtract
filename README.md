Current version appears to be working on my local system.  Testing has been done on a local machine by adding a mapping in /etc/hosts of the b64 encoded hostname such that it resolves to my machine.  
Theoretically this would work on an actual machine if you were the authoritative name server, but I will need to test/confirm that later.
